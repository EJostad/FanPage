    <h1>PopPunk Isn't Dead!</h1>

    <p>
      If you were in High School, or let's High school age, in the 2000's living in suburbia then you know what I'm talking about. Bands like All Time Low, Forever the Sickest Kids, Paramore, Sume 41, Blink 182, Mayday Parade, and so, so much more. <br></br>
      But what happened at the close of 2009? Did the genre just due off? To some it may have - and thats OK. Part of growing up is being exposed to new musical styles and tastes; with the near-infinite amont of music in the world today there just isn't enough time to enjoy it all. <br></br>
      That said, there are those such as myself that held on to the genre. Was it out of pure nostalgia? Honestly, probably. But that does not take away from the unique, fun, and teen-angst filled sound that is so engrained with being young and reckless.<br></br>
      But that's all in the past, right? <strong>Hell No!</strong>

    <h2>So, why isn't PopPunk dead?</h2>

    <p>
     If all those bands were in their hay-day <em>10+</em> years ago, what am I going on about? Well, bands like <strong>Neck Deep</strong> and <strong>Stand Atlantic</strong> are why!<br></br>
    They take a tried and true formula and put a modern twist on it - bands like these do such an amazing job within the context of the genre that it is hard to believe that they are from the mid-late 2010's!<br></br>
    Honestly, they could have performed in '08 Vans Warped Tour along with Hey Monday and Panic! at the Disco and they'd fit right in.<br></br>

    <h3>Why though? <STONG>EASY</STONG></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Vocals that are similar to the melodies and harmonies of Pop </li>

      <li>Instrumentals more reminiscent of Punk Rock</li>

      <li>Fun to mosh to or sing along at the top of your lungs with!</li>

      <li>see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk">here</a> for more info!</li>
